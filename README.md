### **Diabetes Dataset (Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset)**  

The diabetes dataset is one of the most well-known machine learning datasets in the medical field. It contains medical information about **women from the Pima tribe** in the United States and is used to predict **the likelihood of developing diabetes** based on medical features and lifestyle factors.

### **Dataset Features**  

This dataset contains **8 input features** and **1 target variable**, which indicates whether a person has diabetes or not.  

| Column                        | Description |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| **Pregnancies**               | Number of pregnancies |
| **Glucose**                   | Blood glucose level (mg/dL) |
| **BloodPressure**             | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| **SkinThickness**             | Skin thickness in the triceps area (mm) |
| **Insulin**                   | Insulin level in blood (mu U/ml) |
| **BMI**                       | Body Mass Index (BMI) |
| **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**   | Diabetes genetic history (higher value = higher diabetes risk) |
| **Age**                       | Age of the individual |
| **Outcome**                   | Result (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Healthy) |




### **Purpose of Using This Dataset**  

✅ **Diabetes Prediction:** Using medical features to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not.  
✅ **Analysis of Diabetes Risk Factors:** Examining the impact of features such as age, BMI, and glucose levels on diabetes.  
✅ **Training Machine Learning Models:** Applying algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

### **Conclusion**  

✅ The diabetes dataset is a reliable medical dataset widely used for diabetes prediction.  
✅ It includes patients' medical information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and genetic history.  
✅ It can be utilized for medical data analysis, classification model training, and studying diabetes patterns.
